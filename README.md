# **FloralVibe - Online Flower E-Commerce Platform**

## **Overview**
FloralVibe is a web-based e-commerce platform designed to allow users to browse, purchase, and manage a variety of flowers and related products with ease. The platform offers features such as adding items to cart, buying products, managing wishlists, reviewing purchases, and an admin dashboard for overseeing operations. It aims to provide a seamless and enjoyable shopping experience for flower enthusiasts while empowering administrators with tools to manage inventory, orders, messages, and reviews efficiently.
